![Conky LED bar](http://erik.r.yverling.se/images/external/conky-led-bar.png)

This is my custom Conky LED bar. It's mimicking a traditional LED display and will display values in red if a threshold value is overridden.

Prerequisite
------------
* [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/)
* [OpenLogos](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=45256)
* [LED BOARD REVERSED](http://www.fonts2u.com/led-board-reversed.font)

This script is optimized for an 1920 x 1080 pixel display.

You'll most definitely need to change the variables of this script to suite your machine, but since you are using Conky, I'm confident that you know what you're doing :) 


Installation
------------
Just download the script and save it as `.conkyrc` in your home folder and start Conky.
